This is a parser.
Yeah you problably already guessed that.

This is a parser to parse a commandline into arguments 0 generally being the command.
It uses the AMD module format. (or what ever it's called)
And in my example is load by require.js
But could be loaded by any AMD-module-format-compatible loader.
